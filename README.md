##Description: An AI-Based Recommendation System built using Java and Apache Mahout leverages machine learning to analyze user behavior and provide tailored content or product suggestions. This system processes user preferences and historical data to generate personalized recommendations efficiently.
Key Features & Architecture:
Collaborative Filtering: Uses Mahoutâ€™s algorithms to predict user interests based on past interactions.
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests items similar to those a user has previously engaged with.
Data Processing & Storage: Utilizes Java for managing datasets and performing computations.
Integration with Databases: Supports MySQL, MongoDB, or other databases for storing user preferences.
Machine Learning Models: Implements clustering and classification techniques for improved recommendations.
Scalability & Performance Optimization: Ensures high efficiency in processing large datasets.
E-commerce Product Recommendation: Suggests items based on user browsing and purchase history.
This Java-based recommendation system lays the groundwork for AI-powered personalization in various domains
I am used visual studio code IDE for this project.
